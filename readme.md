Handles the display of your sheet music archive.

== Description ==

The Sheet Music plugin handles a sheet music archive where each tune consists
of a pdf and a png preview image. I made to handle my archive of bagpipe
music, but it can be used for other music archives too.

== Installation ==

Install in `wp-content/plugins` as usual. Then go to
*Admin/Settings/Sheetmusic* and configure the file path and url.

== Changelog ==

1.0
: initial release.
